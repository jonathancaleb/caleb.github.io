This blog is for the founder and startup resources I found most useful during my time as a founder. It's meant to mimic the way the A.I resources mirrored my journey as an ML engineer and web-developer.

**Preamble:**

I recently joined Entrepreneur First (EF) a program for normal people with crazy ideas and strong desires to build a startup. I would say that EF was my first step to seriously trying to build my own business. 
These are the resources I came across during my time in the program that helped me learn. Think of it as a web portal of vetted resources with a little context sprinkled in!
I hope this might be useful to you.

# Why entrepreneurship?


# **You know nothing:**

*This is where I started when I was 21. At this point I'd only been programming for 3 years and have built products for companies before, but never for my own business.*

## The Basics

* Immerse yourself in the [terminology and jargon](https://foundersbook.co/startupcards?utm_content=null&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Friday%20Email&utm_term=4ABCD).
* Learn how to build viral products with NFX's playbook that you can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lgitysae9a4qgm6/8%20Playbooks%20For%20Building%20Viral%20Products.pdf?dl=0)
* It good to have mental models like the ones listed at [Conceptually](https://conceptually.org/concepts) and to keep track of the [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) and [cognitive biases](https://yourbias.is/) that you have as a founder.
* While you certainly can do this alone, it's probably a lot more fun with a partner or a team, look no further than this [shortlist of places to meet co-founders](https://indiehackers.com/post/meeting-cofounders-27-places-to-find-them-780bb9ad73)

# Resources
## Prototyping
* [MakerPad](https://www.makerpad.co/)

## Building
* The [Startup Library](https://startuplibrary.co/) is a Notion-esque collection of resources curated by the Launch House in LA.
* The [Founder Playlist](https://www.pillar.vc/playlist/) is incredibly high quality. Find legal templates, NDAs, offer letters, and so much more.

## Research
* See what's trending at [Exploding Topics](https://explodingtopics.com/)
* As a former researcher, I used a lot of unpaywall and sci-hub to access hard to reach papers. Run into a paywall? Use [12ft.io](https://12ft.io/). Works on Medium, Bloomberg, you name it!

## News Feeds
* Stories of both successful and especially failed startups you can learn from at [Failory](https://www.failory.com/)
* Get to know how some of the most successful companies in the world got their [first 1000](https://www.first1000.co/welcome) customers.
* Learn Product Design at the [Case Study Club](https://www.casestudy.club/)
* This new blog site [Wizen Guides](https://wizenguides.com/) recently launched on ProductHunt, we'll see where it goes!
