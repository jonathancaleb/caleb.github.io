Welcome to my travel log ðŸ˜„ at some point I may split this up into sub-posts but for now this will be maintained as a collection of my travel experiences from least to most recent.

Not every trip is logged here, just the ones I think are worth reading. Some trips involved multiple stops or destinations, the name of each section is the final destination.

Some tips for cheap flights I've learned over the years:
 - Use [Matrix Airfare Search](http://matrix.itasoftware.com/) for finding flights. Google acquired the company in 2011 (for almost $700M) and uses it for Google Flights.
 - According to someone I met who works at Alaska Airlines, when searching for flights, always select for ONE person first before adding other passengers (apparently they infer your price bracket if you start with group flights).
 - Ctrl/Command-Shift-n (visit the site as infrequently as possible, turn off cookies, and don't create an account).
 - The earlier the better.

# Oct 5th 2021, Lisbon - Portugal
- A spontaneous trip with my good friend Abhinav Boyed, who was slated for a 5 week vacation that would include Madrid and Rome (I would only stay for 3 weeks)
- The first remarkable thing I noticed when we landed was how much warmer and humid the air was. The humidity would later come back to cause some nights with rough sleep.
- The second thing we noticed was just how cheap Uber rides were in the city. Even at peak hours in the early AMs and a route from the airport to the city center we spent no more than a total of 7 euro.
- Day 1 was all about resting up and acclimatizing to Lisbon. The black and white limestone streets and steep hills became one of the most memorable characteristics of the city.
- Our hostel, Rodamon, is easily the best hostel I had ever stayed at in my life, and at a generous price no less. I will gladly stay at any other of their locations in Europe.
- A bit of context before I rattle off about the food; Abhinav was formerly a vegetarian, and so many of the things we tried was his first time trying it. 
- A run down of all the food we had and highly recommend:
  - The Pastel de Nata was insane; needless to say it was beyond any custard tart I have ever had in my life (including the Hong kong style I grew up with). Sprinkle some cinnamon for a kick. Delicious with a latte or orange juice (which is always fresh squeezed in Lisbon)
  - Real piri piri chicken kicks the shit out of Nando's (it turns out real piri piri sauce is more akin to a chili oil)
  - Seafood is a specialty in the region and they have stores dedicated to selling nothing but canned sardines. The Octopus and Squid were also a highlight, I particularly liked it grilled and in Paella.
  - The food at Time Out Market was both expensive but well worth it. Ground burger made the best burger I ever had in my life. It was here that I also tried Iberco ham for the first time.
  - Local food is pretty simple, oddly enough the one thing that they almost always serve with anything you order is bread, olives, and fries.
  - Vegetarian and vegan food in Europe is starting to become more and more popular. We went to a fancy restaurant called Arkhe and as a self diagnosed carnivore it really opened my eyes as to how delicious and filling vegetarian and vegan food can be.
  - Grilled pork ribs at O Taxi were another major highlight. Marinaded very simply with citrus (lime and orange I think) and tons of garlic and olive oil. It's very unlike the sweet and saucy style that is so often served in the Americas.
  - Francesinha is another dish that I had heard about and tried at a local diner called Lucimar. It was very good but I found it a bit overindulgent and prefer the more refined croque monsieur.
  - Thai takeout in Lisbon is very good. So good that I had it twice. I generally think that Canada has some of the best asian food in the world, and that Europe isn't as good at doing asian food, but Thai cuisine is an exception. The Thai experiences I've had in London, Paris, and Lisbon are testament to that.
  - Travesseiro in Sintra was an eye-opening experience. Besides Pastel de Nata, pastries in Portugal seem simple and unpretentious compared to French pastry. They emphasize the use of nuts, particularly Almonds, to make a variety of delicate sweets.
  - Croquettes are a big deal in this part of the world. The variety you can choose from makes for an interesting experience. Worth trying for sure!
  - McDonald's in Lisbon is decidedly worse than in Canada. Abhinav tells me McD's in India is pretty crazy though so I'll have to try that at some point.
- I used an electric scooter for the second time in my life, there are like 5 different brands competing in Lisbon which has helped drive prices to reasonable levels. Scooters would be a frequent mode of transportation for us in both Lisbon and Madrid.
- The Belem area was exactly as advertised; a great mix of touristy and local vibes, all the major attractions are within walking distance.
- The Castle of Sao Jorge on the top of the hill is another must visit. Go a couple hours before sunset to explore the grounds and finish with a sunset view of the city.
- Party life is on point in Lisbon. Pretty much any night of the week you can catch something crazy going on at Pink Street and the Bairro Alto neighborhood. Things start getting crazy around midnight and last until early morning.
- Visit the museum of Calouste for some amazing archaeological artifacts. The garden behind the museum is the perfect place to read a book or just sit and daydream.
- We visited Sintra one day, and quickly found out that we could have dedicated at least a week just for the region. It was beautiful and authentic and the garden estate is an underrated attraction. It's worth visiting the tourist center for some pointers!

# Oct 20th 2021, Madrid - Spain
- Madrid had so many good food options it was honestly hard to pick what to prioritize. I'm glad we got to try the following:
  - Churros con Chocolate; way better than the version that's dusted in cinnamon and sugar. It's such a fun eating experience and hits all the right spots when it's a bit chilly outside.
  - Tortilla; simple ingredients coming together to become greater than the sum of its parts. That's tortilla.
  - Paella; sure it wasn't from Valencia, but the Paella in Madrid already blew my mind enough. One bite and I knew it's in my top 3 favorite mixed rice dishes of all time.
  - Tacos; I had heard a lot about mexican and tex-mex style tacos but the Spanish version is also something to note. Also the decision of corn vs flour tortilla is a lot less trivial than I thought.
  - Iberco Ham; Of all the charcuterie I've tried Iberco ham is far and away my favorite. It has this flavor that's like a procuitto and chinese lap cheung hybrid. It's fatty and savory and genuinely one of the best things I had the pleasure of eating on this excursion.
  - Sangria; I'm currently obsessed wth tea and beer but one day I'll get bored and move onto something else. Probably coffee and cocktails. Learning how to make sangria was both fun and delicious.
  - We also had Five Guys and it tasted just like Five Guys at any other part of the world, which is to say very good. Did you know 5 guys were actually in reference to the 5 brothers (and one father) that built the company?
- People here are so nice! Like Scandinavian-countries level nice. In Lisbon too, everyone seems happy to help you and hear you out. The tourist center at the square gave us some valuable insight for the best places to visit during our stay.
- Mercado de San Miguel is a place I would really like to spend more time at. I had never seen a market that managed to integrate the idea of tapas and make it the center of the eating experience.
- We visited a huge Primark and I was reminded of why I love this clothing company so much. Simple european fashion done well and at low prices.
- The archeology museum of Madrid is a notable attraction. It's arranged like a walk through the timeline of human history. Entry was free when I visited, but unfortunately the top floors were closed.
- Museo Nacional del Prado was indeed an enormous museum and art gallery. I think we only covered 25% of all the exhibitions in a few hours.
- The garden in Retiro is absolutely beautiful and a must visit on a beautiful day. Go to the pond in the middle of the park and see the small palace. Be sure to bring a loved one!
- Templo de Debod and the Royal Palace are ideal targets for a day trip.

# Aug 10th 2022, New York - USA
- We hit the road-trip at about 10pm, taking several stops to recharge the Tesla, take breaks, and switch drivers.
- Day 1
  - We made a pit stop at Dunkin' and got iced coffee and way too many breakfast sandwiches. We arrived in Manhattan at around noon or so.
  - After a much-needed shower and nap, we visited Joe's pizza for a couple pies (some of the best pizza in NY but massively overpriced) and went to a rehearsal studio near Times square to meet up with the band.
- Day 2
  - Slept in to catch up on two nights worth of sleep, woke up and headed straight to Levain Bakery for some brioche and an insane chocolate chip and walnut cookie.
  - I met with Kevin at the Museum of Natural History and made the rounds. Visited the featured shark exhibition. Had oysters and fish for dinner at Crave Fishbar and dessert at a Van Leeuwen Ice Cream.
  - We took the subway back to Kevin's place near Times Square and met up with Abhinav before making our way down to Littlefield in Brooklyn for the show.
  - Had drinks after the show nearby and late night snacks at plan b in Koreatown.
- Day 3
  - Slept in again, packed and dropped off our bags at Shoreham. Had the best oat latte of my life and a decent almond croissant from Blue Bottle Coffee.
  - Met with Jasmine and roamed around Soho and Chinatown, snacking on rice pudding, Liang Pi, Hand pulled noodles, Xiao Long Bao, and other goodies.
  - Met with Tonie and his girlfriend for Chinese family style dinner at Congee Village, had some addictive spicy salt and pepper clams. Ended the night with some fantastic Ube ice cream at Smoove
- Day 4
  - Woke up and got a Hojicha latte from Blue Bottle (these guys don't miss). Met with Jasmine for lunch at Gupshup, had the most insane morrel mushroom dish I've ever had, and a very interesting spicy mango lassi with green chilli
  - Dropped by the world's Flagship Uniqlo on 5th Ave, the Starbucks reserve at Chelsea, and Chelsea market for some great Halva and oat milk ice cream, Japanese-style tacos, and an assortment of baos. We walked the Highline to the Vessel and ended the night at the Ice Cube Apple store.
  - Started the morning with Dunkin Iced coffee, a 6 pack of donuts, Birria tacos from a food truck nearby, and gyro and Shawarma from the original Halal guys food cart. We reached the MoMa before it got too hot outside.
  - That same day we had oysters and shrimp cocktail, fried brie with honey mustard, avocado spaghetti, ice cream cookies, giant cream puffs, and a slice of pizza that same day. I don't know how I didn't gain weight.
- Day 5
  - We had Levain bakery cookies, baguette with jam and butter, and a slice of coffee cake before walking through central park and heading over to the MET.
  - For dinner we had omakase at Tanoshi Sushi and Sake bar. It was 13 courses an my favorite nigiri was the salmon with torched yuzu miso. The scallop with tuna was a close second. It was byob and we brought a bottle of white wine. For dessert we had Van Leeuwen ice cream.
- Day 6
  - Woke up, caught up on some work, and met with Jasmine for lunch at Shake Shack. I had a double Shack Burger with cheese fries and an Oreo shake. We took a stroll through Bryant park and stopped to listen to the ragtime pianist. We dropped by the NY Public Library and saw some really cool manuscripts.
  - Ramy and I headed to Newark airport very early, and were lucky to get our flights bumped to an earlier time. We flew back to Toronto and were settled in back home by 10.
- I still think about the food I had.
