# League of Legends

I have nothing to say about this game except that I regret every moment and dollar I spent on it.

But I appreciate that it helped developed my taste.

# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

> My favorite game of all time

My childhood was filled with Zelda. Even when I wasn't the one playing it, I was surrounded by people who loved the games.
I remember being scared of the cutscenes in Twilight Princess. I remember loving the aesthetic of Wind Waker. I remember link's little war cry in Minish Cap.
But my Zelda journey really began in 2020, at around the same time I picked up my first serious video game since I quit League of Legends.
It had been around 5 years at this point since I had quit LOL. I moved in with my friends at the University of Waterloo, one of whom is a dear friend and fellow software developer Nikhil Budathoki.
He's not what I would call a gamer per se, but he most certainly appreciates games, as I did too. He played XBox games by creating a new email and signing up for that 3 month free any-game subscription that Microsoft offers.
I told him that I was open to get back into a healthy relationship with gaming and I told him about my history with games and what kind of games I respond best to. When I finished explaining, he straight up offered to gift me his limited edition Fortnite Battle Royale Nintendo Switch.
A mutual friend, Lavan (also at Waterloo) sent me his nintendo account details so I could try out the games he had.
You have to understand that this Switch is more than a gaming console worth a few hundred dollars to me.
Ever since he gave it to me, it has been responsible for countless hours of joy and memories with the people closest to me.
I can't appreciate it enough.

# My Friend Pedro

> You gotta love games that know how to make you feel like a badass

I discovered this game while watching a video from videogamedunkey. He had made a video about a compilation of games he was excited to try, and My Friend Pedro was one of the notable indie games
I distinctly remember seeing how the player could throw a frying pan in the air and shoot at it to ricochet bullets and take out enemies. That was the tidbit that caught my interest.
When I got my hands on the switch this was one of the few indie games I purchased, but I never got around to playing it until one day, when I got bored of Link's Awakening, I opened the game for the first time.
I was totally hooked. The controls were tight (with a few exceptions) and the gameplay was as advertised. I was taking out enemies with skateboards, landing headshots in bullet time, and spin-dodging bullets like a ballerina.
Although I finished the game hard mode, there's a part of me that would have liked to try bananas mode.
My Friend Pedro immediately reminded me of Katana Zero, an indie game that I love very much for its compelling story mixed with exciting and action packed gameplay.

My Friend Pedro certainly trumped Katana Zero in the department of level design; whereas in Katana Zero, the level layouts were simple to focus the gameplay on finding efficient and fun ways to take out the enemies, in my Friend Pedro, the levels were clever puzzles that had to be solved in between shootouts.
I enjoyed that they managed to make it surprising by putting an enemy immediately after a puzzle or platforming section just to keep you on edge.
The game never felt unfair or overtly difficult, and had enough satisfying moments where I could just let the bullets fly to make the experience genuinely fun.

As great as this game was, there were still things for me to nitpick. I found the controls to be smooth when it came to aiming, walking, and dodging, but rolling was a bit more difficult to pull off, especially at the levels where the player had to think fast.
Although this is certainly more of an opinion from personal taste, I wasn't a fan of the art style or the color palette. The environments didn't pop and it was often not as easy as it should have been to identify in game objects that I could interact with as a player.
I thought the story was fun and the twist was well executed for such a short game, but the dialog was somewhat awkward, and was a bit distracting.
Finally, my biggest qualm with My Friend Pedro is the music. The music in Katana Zero was so memorable, I continue to listen to its soundtrack to this day. The music in My Friend Pedro has more of an ambient edge, and although it suited the environment and art style, I wish it was a bit as dynamic and exciting as the gameplay.

# Inside

> Haunting atmosphere, deep visual storytelling, and immersive sound design.

This game scarred me for life. There are moments in this game that had my heart racing and mind utterly unable to process the situation.
There's little I can say about this game without spoiling it, and that really matters because so much of what makes Inside top 3 games of my life is the story.
To me, Inside is a horror-drama side-scrolling 3D puzzle platformer, and the second most unforgettable game I've ever played.

The art style and design complimented the story so well and truly added to the immersion, another element I consider crucial when playing inside.
The faceless in game characters really give that feeling of apathy and cold-heartedness that brought the mood down to the right level.
Even the protagonist, who remains unnamed and unfaced, allowed me to project my own name and face onto his body, and really made me feel like I was in that dark forest, that dilapidated lab, and that deadly audio-driven pulse field.

# Katana Zero

> My favorite indie game of all time

When my good friend Nikhil Budathoki gave me his Nintendo Switch, he also gave me a list of recommended titles he thought I should check out.
One of his key endorsements was the game Katana Zero. He had been recommended the game by his boss during his intern at Epic Games, and if that isn't the endorsement you needed to hear, I don't know what is.
Katana Zero is my 3rd favorite video games, and the only game I've played where, when I finished it after about 6 hours, I wished there was more.

The spritework and artstyle is right up my alley. The pixels weren't too blocky and the characters felt animated and alive, well-supported by the fantastic dialog.
The music by LudoWic, Bill Kiley, and Co. paired so perfectly with the game's aesthetic, mood, and pacing. Stealth sequences had the ambience and moodiness needed to remind me when to take it slow. Action sequences had the heart-racing fast-paced drum and bass influence.
I still find myself listening to the soundtrack (specifically Overdose and Breath of the Serpent) and have yet to find more music like it.

# Kirby and the Forgotten Land

> The only game to truly fill the Kirby shaped hole in my nostalgia fueled heart.

There were 3 titles that I was obsessed with when I was a snot-nosed kid playing my DS Lite under the pillow at midnight:
 - New Super Mario Bros.
 - Professor Layton original trilogy
 - Kirby's Adventure

So when Kirby and the Forgotten Land was announced, I was certain I'd get the game on release day.
In all departments, Kirby and the Forgotten Land isn't the Mario Odyssey killer that I had hoped.
The soundtrack isn't as beautiful, the open world isn't as open, and the mechanics aren't as extensive, but somehow, I actually enjoyed Kirby more.
Hal Labs really breathed life into what was beginning to seem like a fading star of a franchise, and I'm excited to see where they go next.

# Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker

> Cute and creative.

Some games aren't meant to blow you away with scale, graphics, or gamepaly. Sometimes the simple things are what we appreciate more. Captain Toad is the perfect example of such a game.
Small and compact levels, a cute little soundtrack, and simple yet engaging puzzles kept me playing until the end. There's even a two player mode for when you want to relax with someone else.
I found myself constantly thinking "How did they think of this?" which is honestly no surprise, we're talking about the designers of Mario games after all!

This game is the perfect break from the AAA game fatigue you might get after gaming hard for a while. It's incredibly forgiving and has in-game features that would satisfy any perfectionist. You literally can't screw up.

# Cuphead

> A game I respect as much as I love.

Cuphead was a game I had my eye on even before I got my Switch. I had heard about this game and it's development history, the incredible soundtrack by Kristofer Maddigan, and the world-record "Most hand-drawn frames of animation in a video game".
Made by two brothers from the breadbasket of Canada, the Moldenhauer brothers moved to Ontario's Oakville for development of Cuphead. This game is a labour of love 7 years in the making.
When I first play this game I played with a friend and we took hours to beat Ruse of an Ooze. Later, my roomates came home and proceeded to spend 2 hours on the boss.
I learned pretty quickly that the secret to beating Cuphead's suite of bosses is persistence and ability to not lose your shit over dying to a spinning shrimp or an exploding chocolate bar.

I loved all the parry levels from the DLC and the main game (I'm really happy they made use of it even more in the DLC with the chess themes bosses).
I remember how hard the parry part of the tutorial was, and I found that the timing was a fun mechanic to master over time. The run and gun levels are a good breather from the twitchy high-stress boss battles that dominate the islands of Cuphead's world map.
But of course, the boss battles are what make the game. The subtle telegraphs demand your attention but you have to find a way to consider the 50 projectiles also flying around the screen; it's just really chaotic fun.
The different weapons add a bit of variety to your gameplay, and the plane battles (although not as fun as the normal bosses and a bit harder) where a solid addition to the code gameplay.
The watercolor backgrounds are all uniquely beautiful. Kristofer Maddigan's soundtrack just brings life to the beautiful hand animated boss phases. Jazz just feels so right in a game like this, it adds to the cute and fun but also frantic feeling.

My favorite songs are:
- Ruse of an Ooze
- Botanic Panic
- Floral Fury
- Snow Cult Scuffle
- Gnome Way Out

I did actually find a glitch in the game, and it happened on the King Dice boss battle. I had beaten all the mini-bosses which left King Dice him self.
After the first set of cards from his right hand, I might have parried something wierdly, but King Dice kept his hand down with the hand animation as if it were releasing the cards again, except this time nothing came out.
The animation just kept running in a loop while the hitbox (his big head in the middle of the screen) was left vulnerable.
I exploited this bug and kept shooting at him until I beat him. Incidentally, up until I happened to trigger this bug, King Dice was the hardest boss in the game for me (followed closely by Dr. Kahl's Robot and the Devil himself)
