This post is to talk about my favorite movies.

I've ranked each entry roughly in order of most favorite to least favorite.
Also there's a special section on a few other topics around movies I think are worthy of discussion!

# Everything, Everywhere, All at Once

> "When I Choose To See The Good Side Of Things, I'm Not Being Naive. It Is Strategic And Necessary. It's How I Learned To Survive Through Everything." - Waymond

I watched this movie with the highest expectations and it still blew me away. Never before have I cried and laughed so much in a movie at the same time before. I realize it definitely isn't for everyone. Not all the friends I watched it with in theatres felt about EEAO the same way I did. None of them walked out of the theatre having ugly-cried through the final act. 

# Blade Runner 2049

> Joi: Mere data makes a man. A and C and T and G. The alphabet of you. All from four symbols. I am only two: 1 and 0.
> 'K': Half as much but twice as elegant, sweetheart.


## Key Takeaways

Denis Villeneuve reached peak filmmaking with this one. Hans Zimmer with his brooding yet beautiful, glacially droning score.
Mesa remains top 10 best soundtrack-screenplay synergistic moments of my life.
I thought a lot about what it meant to be human during and after the movie.
 
Also can you believe this movie made me fall in love with a hologram?

# Scott Pilgrim vs The World
> I wanna fight you for me... "SCOTT EARNED THE POWER OF SELF-RESPECT"

This movie is just SO FUN. The moment it was revealed that the setting was in Toronto (they even filmed at Casa Loma) I knew this was going to be a top 10 for life.

# Me, Earl, and the dying girl
> "That is why fiction sucks. None of that happened. Instead, pretty much everything happened that I was afraid of, except worse."

This was the only YA book I ever read in my life, and I'm so grateful. I'm not a fan of fiction but when 14 year old picked up this book for the first time and read the first few words, I was hooked.
"Me, Earl, and the dying girl" simply isn't your typical feel good novel with lots of young romance and serendipitous moments. This book is about death and insecurity and college applications.
This book connected with me because despite being fiction, the characters, the environment, and the writing was so real, with no effort to create a fantasy world where everything is peaches and gravy.
When the movie was released in 2015 I fell in love with the movie because it echoed my own experience in high school.

# 500 Days of Summer
> "Look, I know you think she was the one, but I don't. Now, I think you're just remembering the good stuff. Next time you look back, I, uh, I really think you should look again."

Sometimes you watch a movie for the first time and you realise just how similar you are to the protagonist. And it's not a good thing, it's honestly really embarrassing!
500 Days of Summer is one of those relatable movies with asshole characters that makes it feel like I'm watching a dramatized copy of my own life-story.

# Top Gun: Maverick
> "Don't think just do" - Maverick

Ego, respect, skill. "Top Gun: Maverick" took me by surprise as the summer blockbuster that actually hit the spot among a relatively slow release schedule this season.
I had never watched the original Top Gun, but like with Blade Runner 2049, not having seen the original did not degrade my love for both these movies.
The intense joyrides, dogfights, and social situations gripped me even as I was watching at 2am in the morning.
Sharp witty dialogue, believable action, and strong performances all around elevated the experience.
The script left little for exposition and instead focuses on how that history has affected the charaters of the movie, which I really love.
The action made me wish I had seen it in theatres; symmetrical shots aren't always compelling but in a movie like this it simply looks gorgeous.
Tom cruise keeps cementing himself as our generation's action star (they need to put him in a movie with Keanu Reeves), and Miles Teller really looks the part he was meant to play.

# Game of Thrones

# House of the Dragon

## Ep. 1

## Ep. 2

## Ep. 3
Viserys has officially lost two of his fingers on his left hand from the cut he received when he reprimanded Daemon. \
The white Hart showing itself to Rhaenyra (and Ser Criston) is definitely symbolic for something; especially since she decided not to have it killed. \
King Viserys killing a hart with a Lannister spear is also definitely a sign of something. \
The King's repeated dreams are going to be the death of him. \
THe King's promise to Rhaenyra that she will remain on his first choice for the succession will be kept. \
I give it two episodes (ep. 6) before the young actors are replaced by the older ones.

## Ep. 4
Rhaenyra is definitely not made for the life of a wife. \
I can't not love Daemon and I swear it's just Matt being too good at his job. \
I love that tender moment of rekindled friendship between Alicent and Rhaenyra. \
The idea that Alicent also despises her duties is something I hadn't considered until this episode... \
The editing at the brothel scene intercut with Viserys and Alicent is inSANE this episode made me feel so unconfortable at so many levels for many reasons... \
- Alicent probably doesn't feel anything because she's had so many babies at this point. \
- In similar spirit, Daemon is also numb to pleasure. \
- Rhaenyra is a horny teen and Ser Criston made a huge mistake. \
The Lannisters have nothing on the Targaryens. \
"I SWeaR tO yOu uPoN tHE MeMOrY oF My mOThER" apparently means nothing now. \
Daemon doesn't even TRY to deny the tryst. I've noticed that he seems to be very truthful in communication.  \
Otto weaponizes the truth. He's the smartest member of the court. Viserys should have dealt with him better and far earlier. \
Viserys is not looking good. I think his bloodline is kind of prone to disease. His dad died of a burst belly and now he's just a walking corpse. \

## Ep. 5
Lady Rhea Royce was a fantastic character and so easy to fall in love with; too bad Daemon doesn't feel the same. \
Daemon hates situations where he isn't in control and he hates people who don't put up with his shit. I think his occasional impotence stems from this as well. \
Criston isn't very smart. It's incredibly naive to think that Rhaenyra would ditch the crown for him. \
Alicent feels betrayed but Rhaenyra technically didn't lie to her; she didn't sleep with Daemon! \
I think Corlys is ok with the whole last name thing because he knows that he can deal with that after Viserys has died. \
Harwin "Breakbones" Strong is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters. I also love the brotherly dynamic between him and Larys. \
This is the second time we see a Joffrey killed at a wedding in the GOT universe. \

## Ep. 6
Lynel is such a good guy, it kinda sucks that he's being dragged into this mess despite trying his best. It kind of reminds me of Viserys himself. \
Rhaenyra is actually making strides in her political gaming, the offer of marriage between her son and Alicent's daughter was a great plus an egg to boot! Well played. \
Viserys is losing power fast, it's ridiculous that he just lets everyone around him scheme. \
"He must close one eye first"... Halaena do foreshadowing though. \
Interesting that Criston isn't wearing his cloak anymore... \
High key Criston is a simp. \
Daemon faced with the same question that Viserys was, and he makes the right one. \
It's so interesting to me that the dragons are obedient enough as to kill their own master. \
The last thing Harwin says to Rhaenyra is that when they next meet, he will be "a stranger". He dies immediately after. Could the stranger be one of the gods in the faith of the 7, he who represents death? \
Did Larys literally have his brother and dad killed? This guy needs to be put down. \

## Ep. 7
I hate funerals :( \
DID HE JUST CALL HER AEMMA LMAOO \
It's crazy to me that Corlys thinks Rhaenys should be queen more than she does. It makes me sad that they can't agree on this. \
It also says a lot how Corlys wanted Rhaenys on the throne not necessarily because he believes that it was her right, but because it would have put his bloodline on the throne. \
I gotta say, Aemon totally earned Vhagar. \
Kids are such a nasty business. \
Viserys cannot help but sound like a goddamn child when dealing with the situation... \
Alicent still picks at her hands. \
We play an ugly game is such an underrated line. \
Let's be real here Otto would trade a dragon for any one of his grandsons in a heartbeat. \
Rhaenyra and Laenor continue to be a surprisingly fantastic couple. \
Happy for Laenor but I feel so bad for the Valaryons. \

## Ep. 8
Emma D'arcy's acting when she goes to see her father during the storm at night was sublime. \
Jace and Luke are way better kids it's not even close. \
OK VISERYS GO OFFF OMG I'M GONNA CRY DAEMON HELPING VIS TO THE THRONE FUCKKK. \
Please do the mercy of letting Viserys die :( he's a walking corpse. EVERYONE'S ACTING IS SO GOOD. \
That apology from Rhaenyra feels like she's saying sorry for what's to come. \
Alicent and Vis holding hands at the dinner table :( \
Rhaenyra saying she will return on dragonback... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM \
Oh my god I'm DONE lmao I'M SO DONE. I can't believe that's how it goes down. \

## Ep. 9
What a crazy episode! \
Alicent STILL picks at her fingers when she's nervous \
Harrold Westerling being an absolute badass at the small council meeting and walking out like Barristan Selmy was just so fitting for a man with honor. A part of me wishes that he took Criston's head first. \
The division between the two twin kingsguard is pretty awesome to see actually, I wonder how their story will end. \
The mention of Yi Ti was awesome! Gives me hope that there's a chance we'll see more of it in the future :) \
Alicent is more nuanced and complex as a character and that's awesome, but Rhaenys is right about her being complicit to the men of the world. \
Melys coming up from beneath the dragonpit was just so cool. Also probably the coolest looking dragon. Rhaenys is now my second favorite character behind Daemon. \
The irony of Aegon not wanting the throne is just too good. Really throws everyone who thought that not wanting the throne is a prerequisite for being a good ruler a bit off. You can see the moment he realizes would be loved as king, and relishes in that realization. \

## Ep. 10
And with that, we wrap up season 1! \
Daemon looked to sad and hurt when Rhaenys told them of Viserys' passing. \
Dude this is like the 4th birthgiving scene in the show and arguably the most painful to watch. \
I think Rhaenyra knew that the baby was dead... also the stillborn looks like it has wierd scales on its skin?? \
I don't know if this will ever happen but it'd be cool to see all the kingsguard knights duke it out; 3 on 3, brother vs brother (literally with Erryk and Arryk!) \
Rhaenys continues to be my second favorite character and my personal candidate for the best possible queen of the 7 kingdoms. \
Daemon's continued violence continues to make it hard to like him as a character. \
The entire Vhagar sequence was gorgeously shot; they made her look absolutely terrifying and beautiful at the same time. \
I really like that they made it clear that Aemond did not actually want to kill Luke, and that they both simply lost control of their Dragons... "Dragons are a power that man should never have trifled with." \
Rhaenyra having her mad queen arc super early in the show huh.
