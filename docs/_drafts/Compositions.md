This post is for explaining the ideas and inspirations of the music I make.

# Preamble
Some of my earliest memories is deeply connected to music.
My parents were believers in the "Classical music makes babies smart" school of thought, so I distinctly remember falling asleep to the delicate strings of Mozart and his contemporaries.
To this day I often use music, ambience, and ASMR to cure the occasional bout of insomnia.

I started playing piano when I was young, around age 4.
Back then I was more interested in Lego than music, so my mum would often have to drag me to the piano to sit and watch me practice.
As a teen I realized she was never going to let me quit piano no matter how much I whined and complained, so I figured that if I was going to be forced to do it, I'd find a way to enjoy it.

One day I heard a song on the radio, Richard Marx's "Right Here Waiting", a sweet (albeit a bit saccharine) pop song, and an "AHA!" moment. I decided to learn how to play it on the piano.
From that moment on, I loved the piano. To this day, even after having long forgotten how to play the very song that inspired this passion, I still love the piano.
There was even a time when I wanted to be a composer for film score or producer for EDM; music has meant, still means, and will always mean a lot to me.

I took weekly lessons with a tutor until reaching grade 8 or something pathetic, before finally quiting and continuing on my own.
Today I listen to music about 6-8 hours daily, (including the hours I play piano).
I also play a bit of guitar and bang around on the old drum kit at home. When I'm feeling chaotic I'll pull out my Otamatone (my wah wah boi as I like to call it).
On Spotify I have playlists for just about anything, from EDM to Metal, Trap to Indie, Pop to Ambience, Electro-Swing to Future-Funk; if it slaps, it slaps.
But a little less than half my time with music is spent with instrumental/orchestral music, all 15,000+ songs, which I keep locally on iTunes (MP3s, AACs, etc.) or Sony Music Center (FLACs, AIFFs, etc.).

It is to this genre that I must swear fealty. Almost anything I make owes its existence to Two Steps From Hell, Really Slow Motion, and Audiomachine.
If you are familiar with the genre you may notice that my style, prose, and sound is noticeably similar.

Throughout my life I used the piano as an emotional outlet. To vent and to release, to comfort me when I'm sad and lift me higher when I'm happy.
I struggle to play in front of people because of how deeply personal the piano and music in general is to me. I feel as if I'm revealing my soul to the audience.
Recently I figured that if I enjoy it so much, even if there's a small chance someone else will enjoy hearing it, I might as well provide the opportunity.
The final push was by my girlfriend, who inspired me to finish what I was working on and to publish them, however mediocre they might be.

Playing piano is like observing snowflakes; every time is different, every time you sit and play you create something new.

Playing piano is like having a conversation; you talk by playing a key and the piano responds by singing a note.

Playing piano is like giving yourself a hug; you play something beautiful and you get to hear it. Only you.

To quote a lyric from one of my favorite songs:

# Movement Series

## Chenille | Papillon
> "Metamorphosis personified"

Technically, Papillon was made first, but naturally, Chenille is played first. The caterpillar comes before the butterfly.
Chenille was made in a day when I got bored of practicing Papillon and stumbled upon a "lazier" way to play it.
Chenille is a version of Papillon where the chords are broken. The motion of the player's hands mimic the patterned crawl of a caterpillar.
Although technically it is its own song, it could be seen as the first part of a two part song.

The name "Papillon" (French for butterfly) comes from the way one's hands are positioned when playing the song.
The two thumbs are intertwined while the other finger are spread apart to imitate the wings of a butterfly.
It's played daintily with certain moments emphasized by volume, but otherwise fairly consistent throughout.

Papillon is the first song I ever publically released. It is meant to summarize the journey I took to creating my own music.
The song starts small, change is hesitant, and the "wings" are kept close to a familiar and comfortable position.
As the first movement plays out, the butterfly is forced to confront discomfort and change in pursuit of something beautiful.
The key changes range from hopeful, to vigilant, and finally to joyful. But it always returns to its original verse.
The song keeps its binary pattern up until the end, when the butterfly learns to break free.
The final broken chords signify moving forwards towards an uncertain future, but the hands come together to imply that no matter where it goes, it will not forget its roots.

This story the song portrays describes my relationship with piano and composition.
I think it's fitting that my first release is a reflection of the journey to get to this point.

## Aeolian
> "Relating to or arising from the action of the wind."

This song stems from one of the earliest original melodies I created (2016??) and kept in mind for all these years until I completed it in 2020. I distinctly remember how playing it made me feel better during tough times.
The original inspiration came from the first time I watched a particular scene in the Harry Potter movie series.
In the 5th movie, Order of Pheonix, the dastardly Professor Umbridge has kept the students of Hogwarts under her iron fist.
As the students are writing their O.W.Ls, (the wizard/witch version of the S.A.T), Fred and George Weasley burst into the great hall flying on broomsticks and throwing magical fireworks.
The awesome soundtrack by Nicolas Hooper stuck with me over all those years and directly inspired
The music from Patrick Doyle, Alexandre Desplat, and of course John Williams (who scored the other movies) stuck with me as well.

To me, the melody has an airy quality, constantly flowing and moving freely without dwelling on any moment. Icarus takes flight for the first time. It's only at the bridge does the tone and pace reflect a calmer, more composed, and mildly concerning stance. Icarus rises above the clouds and flies closer to the sun. By the third act we reach the twist; Icarus survives! He soars above and beyond the clouds and disappears into the horizon.

Aeolian is also a mode used in music theory.

## Samara
> "More commonly referred to as “helicopters,” “whirlers,” “twisters” or “whirligigs,” Samaras are the winged seeds produced by maple trees."

Autumn is my favorite season. Everything from the flavors to the fashion is leagues above any other season in my book.
Seeing everything transition is refreshing.
I wrote the cue for this song one autumn day a few years ago.
I was trying to channel the many qualities of autumn, the cool wind, changing colors, and the smell of changing seasons.
In August 2021, I revisited the cue and gave it a bit more life.
To avoid the torrid summer heat I would ask my dad to turn on the AC and we would go around the house to close all the windows (so as to not let the cold air out).
Over a couple days I composed the core components and arranged the pieces to form the song.
After completing arrangement and attempting to practice I decided to add back a few pieces I trimmed.
One of those pieces is the part where my hands play over each other near the middle of the song.

The song starts with the first leaves of autumn falling to the ground.
Like the descent of a samara leaf (or helicopter leaf as I used to call it) the pattern is brief and predictable.
After a few changes in key, the song takes a turn in tone, signifying the change in weather.
Near the end, the original melody can be heard but much slower and in a new key, symbolizing the final change to winter as a snowflake slowly drifts to the ground.

The song starts high and descends in a controlled but not predictable manner.

## Dulcet
> "Something nice"

Dulcet started as a simple, unassuming motif. Usually when creating something I have an idea of how it will end.
But in extreme cases; very complex or very simple songs, it is difficult to have a vision. For complex songs it is simply because complexity means more possibilities.
In the simple case the opposite problem is true; I just don't know where to take it. But I know I like the motif, so I hold on to it.

I revisited the idea around the same time as Samara, and one day I let instinct take over and I built upon the song.
After a few days of toying with the idea I finished the composition. I don't really remember what I was thinking but I feel really happy with the result.
I struggled to find a name for this short and sweet bit of music, but eventually, as random as it's conception, I came across a word with a description that does the song justice; Dulcet.


## Gravity

## Ablation
Ablation has many unrelated definitions, so the one that applies depends on context:
> "1. (In Biology/Neuroscience) The surgical removal of body tissue."
> "2. (In Machine/Deep Learning) A procedure where certain parts of the network are removed, in order to gain a better understanding of the network’s behaviour."
> "3. (In Climatology/Meteorology) The removal of snow and ice by melting or evaporation, typically from a glacier or iceberg."

This song was by far the hardest of this series to play. To this day I can't play it perfectly, I often have to omit portions of what I intend to play. The speed at which it is to be played makes it difficult to emphasize certain notes and the range of keys played at a time stretches my hands to its physical limits. But it is one of my favorites for being a true labour of love.

The first time I encountered the term Ablation was actually in the context of Biology.
I was studying medical terms for HOSA (for a trivia-esque competition).
It was only much later that I read the appendix of some ML paper that used the term "Ablation Study" that I actually googled the term and discovered its third definition, with which I decided to aptly dedicate this song.

## Foreshore/Estuary
> "Or intertidal zone is the part of a shore between high- and low-water marks, or between the water and cultivated or developed land."

Foreshore is inspired by the many aquatic themes I've heard in movies, video games, and random tid-bits from anywhere else. Finding Nemo, Mario 64, Donkey Kong Country, 

There were a few obvious decisions to make when creating Foreshore:
- To maintain some notion of consistency and reptition, like the tide.
- To utilize the entire range of notes on the piano, representing the depths of large bodies of water.
- To mimic the qualities of water; the visual sparkle, the rhythmic perturbations, the fluidity and viscosity, etc.

Some of my favorite aquatic themes:
- Donkey Kong Country: Underwater Ambience - 
- Mario 64: Water Level theme - 
- Ori and the Blind Forest: The Waters Cleansed - 

## Diffraction
> "The bending of waves around the corners of an obstacle or through an aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle/aperture."

This is meant to be a simple tune that takes advantage of the entire range of notes on the piano, analogous the range of visible light (colour) in the electromagnetic spectrum.
I focused on retaining a constant pace - analogous to the constant speed of light - and on skipping around keys - analogous to how light bends, the effect of which lends its name to this song.

## Nastic
> "(of the movement of plant parts) caused by an external stimulus but unaffected in direction by it."

Nastic is another song whose origins come from a long history of stalling (since 2018) simply because I couldn't move beyond its primary melody.
One day, I mindlessly played something I liked and kept building from there.
The inspiration came from perceptual qualities of forests and jungles and I wanted to capture the mystery and wonder of those environments.
I wanted this to be the theme that plays when you're in the magic woods and the trees start talking and the pixies start popping up.

This is probably one of my favorite songs, and I'm very happy with the final composition and arrangement.
In the beginning the emphasis is on the pace, played patiently and almost in anticipation of something.
Near the middle the emphasis switches to the dynamics, which are meant to mimic the breath of nature, with every inhale and exhale causing a rise and fall in volume.
In the end, both are thrown out the window to let the composition shine.
The last part of the song was extremely difficult to play; the arpeggios and key changes were so fast and spread apart it took many months of practice.

Nyctinasty is the circadian rhythmic nastic movement of higher plants in response to the onset of darkness, or a plant "sleeping".

## Flicker/Smolder
> "(of light or a source of light) shine unsteadily; vary rapidly in brightness."

## Subduction/Tectonic
> "Is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced to sink due to high gravitational potential energy into the mantle."

## Streamflow
> "Or channel runoff, is the flow of water in streams, rivers, and other channels, and is a major element of the water cycle."
