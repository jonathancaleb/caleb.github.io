A large portion of how I spend my life involves activities that I taught myself, including development, machine learning, and playing piano (mostly self-taught anyways).
The rest of my time is spent learning how to do those activities.
I like letting work show for itself, but as a way to supplement my lack of formal training, perhaps this post will help show how seriously I take learning, from study to practice.

Some tips:
Use the Table of Contents, the FAQ, etc.

# Practicing
How I practice depends on what I'm trying to develop.
I use university worksheets (graciously provided by my friends at UWaterloo and UofT) to practice math, particularly proofs.
I use Leetcode, Codewars, HackerRank, etc. to practice and test my DSA skills.

# Taking Notes
One of the biggest gripes I have with the linear system of documentation and note taking is that it has bad support for references (graphs)
Tennis Players and Motoryclists (mind automatically isolates and filters noise from details, and tries to commit it to memory)
Why Bio and Med kids succeed with Anki better than Math and CS/SE kids (Mind is trained on a sparse, discrete, limited set of items like a tennis court)
Roam (Manual) vs Metacademy (Curated) vs everynoiseatonce (Automated)
Previously I thought that the different strategies used in learning (rote memorization, practice testing, etc.) each emphasized a particular function for learning.
Now I am more convinced that any learning strategy is a method of exercising one central function; the creation and maintenence of connections.
Rote memorization with flashcards creates a one-to-one connection between two previously unconnected ideas/concepts (an edge of a bipartite graph perhaps).
Practice testing math questions strengthens the connections between question and answer, creating a more robust understanding due to slight variations in the question set (a hyperedge perhaps).
Elaboration/analogization of new concepts creates new connections with previously known concepts (most often with existing concepts that are already well established) to further understand new concepts from multiple perspectives. (Creating a new edge between two disconnected graphs)

In conjunction with both macro and micro scheduling strategies (spaced repetition and interleaving) all the above strategies make quick work of any new concept.
I've also tried incorporating the [Zettelkasten Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOSZOCoqOo8) to my note-taking and reading/writing strategy.

## Anki
I discovered Anki (and it's extended family of like-apps) a few years ago and was immediately hooked.
The UX/UI is barely serviceable, but it's method is reliable and has proven to work with specific use cases.

I have decks for everything from French/Mandarin to Geography to Biochemistry and Medical Terms.
But sometimes there didn't exist a deck for something I wanted to study, or they just weren't that good (missing information, inconsistent cards, strange formatting/style)
So over the years I've created a few and improved upon a few decks.
Here are the ones I made and shared (using this [guide](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual20.html#sharingdecks:~:text=Sharing%20Decks%20Publicly,-To)) *NEED TO CHANGE TO FLEXIBLE LINK*

## Notion
I've used Notion since discovering it a few years ago. It has since grown to integrate many features I find useful.
The assortment of templates and the breadth of block-types to choose from is staggering.
The only qualm I really have besides some feature requests (Google Cal integration and an API) is just the speed; alas, that's the price you pay for using Chromium and Electron ðŸ˜›.

## Roam
I discovered Roam when it was recommended by a friend, Abhinav Boyed, who thought my interest in graphs would apply nicely to a Notion-like personal CMS.
In my humble opinion, Roam is best suited for specific types of information *ELEBORATION NEEDED*.

I recently moved my Roam notes to Obsidian. I found that Obsidian has been developing faster, and I love the flexible paid plans

## Zotero
Having using Zotero and Mendeley, I must say I prefer Zotero.
